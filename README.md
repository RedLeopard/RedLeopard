# 👋 Hi there, I’m Edward Thornton

### ☁️ AWS Solutions Architect | Cloud Engineer 

I am a a tech founder and AWS Solutions Architect recognized by FOX News and DELUX Magazine for creating technology that uplifts communities and drives innovation. My mission is to build cloud systems that empower people — from startups to public-sector transformation.

I’m a Cloud/DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience deploying and managing infrastructure using HashiCorp Terraform and GitHub Actions. Proficient in AWS services including CloudWatch, S3, Route 53, VPC, EC2, IAM (Users & Roles), Lambda, and serverless architectures.

Skilled with Docker and Linux, and experienced in implementing LDAP, a widely used open-source directory protocol. I also apply Agile methodologies with tools such as Jira for project tracking and Confluence for documentation — ensuring clear communication, accountability, and smooth collaboration.

To visualize and communicate infrastructure designs, I use Draw.io to create AWS architecture diagrams, improving transparency and efficiency for all stakeholders.

✨ I believe that clarity, automation, and innovation are the pillars of great cloud engineering — and I make sure to apply them every day.
